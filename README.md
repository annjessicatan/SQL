# MID COURSE PROJECT: MAVEN MOVIES 

## The Situation
The company’s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company’s underwriters
need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy.

## The Objective
**Use MySQL to:**
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer the underwriters’ questions. Each question can be answered
by querying just one table. Part of your job as an Analyst is figuring out which table to use.

## The Letter
```
Dear Maven Movies Management,

In our review of your policy renewal application, we have realized
that your business information has not been updated in a number
of years.

In order to accurately assess the risk and approve your policy
renewal, we will need you to provide all of the following
information.

Sincerely,
Joe Scardycat, Lead Underwriter

# FINAL COURSE PROJECT: MAVEN MOVIES 

## The Situation
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner
who is interested in purchasing Maven Movies. He primarily owns restaurants and bars, so he
has lots of questions for you about your business and the rental business in general. His offer
seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.

## The Objective
**Use MySQL to:**
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer your potential Acquirer’s questions. Each question will require
you to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.

## The Letter
```
Dear Maven Movies Management,

I am excited about the potential acquisition and learning more
about your rental business. Please bear with me as I am new to the industry, but I have a
number of questions for you. Assuming you can answer them all, and that there are no major surprises,
we should be able to move forward with the purchase.

Best,
Martin Moneybags
