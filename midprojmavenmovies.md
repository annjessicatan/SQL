# MID COURSE PROJECT: MAVEN MOVIES 

## The Situation
The company’s insurance policy is up for renewal and the insurance company’s underwriters
need some updated information from us before they will issue a new policy.

## The Objective
**Use MySQL to:**
Leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven
Movies database to answer the underwriters’ questions. Each question can be answered
by querying just one table. Part of your job as an Analyst is figuring out which table to use.

## The Letter
```
Dear Maven Movies Management,

In our review of your policy renewal application, we have realized
that your business information has not been updated in a number
of years.

In order to accurately assess the risk and approve your policy
renewal, we will need you to provide all of the following
information.

Sincerely,
Joe Scardycat, Lead Underwriter
